## üìå Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze **marriage patterns**, focusing on various socio-cultural and economic factors that influence marital outcomes.  

We examined attributes such as:
- Marriage type (love vs. arranged)
- Education
- Caste and religion
- Parental approval
- Dowry exchange
- Marital satisfaction
- Divorce rates

Our goal is to uncover meaningful trends and relationships from this structured data.
